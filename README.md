# hebi_cpp_api_ros_examples

Examples of using HEBI components through ROS, using the HEBI C++ API.

This repository demonstrates integration of the HEBI C++ API with ROS, as well as several system-level demonstrations.

**This is intended to be a replacement for the deprecated `hebi_ros` package.**

## Overview

This package provides a colleciton of nodes which can be used as standalone components of a larger system, or you can use as a starting point for creating your own custom nodes controlling HEBI hardware at a low level.

For full documentation, see the package documentation on the ROS wiki:
